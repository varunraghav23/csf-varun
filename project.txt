1. Project Title

Number Guessing Game – Python Console Application


---

2. Introduction

This mini-project is a simple Number Guessing Game built using the Python programming language.
The program generates a random number between a fixed range, and the player tries to guess the number.
The program provides hints such as “Too High” or “Too Low”.
This game demonstrates basic programming concepts such as:

Variables

Loops

Conditional statements

Random number generation

Input validation


This project also follows proper Git & GitHub workflow, including meaningful commits, documentation, and repository structure.

3. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a small but functional program using Python that takes user input and checks if it matches the random number generated by the system.

Why I chose this project:

Easy to understand and implement

Covers important programming fundamentals

Good example for Git version control practice



---

4. Tools & Technologies Used

Python (v3.x)

VS Code

Git

GitHub

Markdown for documentation



---

5. Features Implemented

Generates a random number between 1 and 100

User can guess until they find the correct number

Validates input to prevent errors

Gives feedback:

“Too High”

“Too Low”


Counts number of attempts

Asks user if they want to play again

11. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the essential concepts of Python programming and how to use Git & GitHub effectively for version control.
It also shows how to document and structure a project professionally.
