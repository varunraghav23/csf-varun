# Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Number Guessing Game. The system selects a random
number, and the user attempts to guess it. The game demonstrates fundamental
programming concepts such as loops, conditions, input handling, and randomness.


# Development Process

1. Planned the game flow and logic.
2. Created main.py in VS Code.
3. Implemented basic input and output.
4. Added random number generation.
5. Added conditions for high/low guesses.
6. Added attempt counter.
7. Added replay feature.
8. Initialized Git repository using git init.
9. Made multiple commits with descriptive messages.
10. Pushed code to GitHub repository.


# Future Improvements

- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Add a graphical interface (Tkinter).
- Add scoring system.
- Save high scores in a file.
- Make a web version using HTML/CSS/JS.
